# remotestate
Hello remotestate recruitment team,
First of all I would like to thank you for giving me this oppurtunity to work on your assignment,
It was something new, challenging yet very exciting for me to work on such assignment.

Honestly it took me less that 2 days for totaly compeleting all the task which was required in the sheet.
good thing is that I was able to perform all the task listed.
It will took a while to test all the API working.

I have given comment on most of the code line, for better understanding of how i derived this please allow me to explain in a meeting.


I have created 3 models,Restautant, Dishes and user, and all the role base thing happend in the user model only.

I created Dishes in such a way that after we create it it will also be added in the restaurant by its Id.

I am using unshift method so it will always be first location for user to be latest thats why i took it in controller of find distance in such a way.

Rest I believe is self explainary and I am all here to explain.

I really look Up for your company and actualy looking forward to work with you.

Thank you
regards
